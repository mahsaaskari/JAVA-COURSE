This branch contains 4 different classe.
The Car class represents a car object that has the following attributes
`id` (an integer): Represents a unique identification number for the car/`make` (a string): Indicates the car's manufacturer or make (e.g., Toyota, Honda)/`model` (a string): Specifies the car's model (e.g., Camry, Civic)/ `color` (a string): Represents the color of the car./`registrationNumber` (a string): Stores the car's registration number./`yearOfManufacture` (an integer): Represents the year when the car was manufactured./`price` (a double): Represents the price of the car.
The class contains a constructor method (`public Car(...)`) that allows you to create a new `Car` object by providing values for the attributes.There is a `getDescription()` method that returns a formatted string with the car's information, including its ID, make, model, year of manufacture, color, price, and registration number.In the `main` method, an array of `Car` objects named `cars` is created. Three `Car` objects are created and assigned to this array, each representing a different car with specific attribute values.A loop is used to iterate through the `cars` array, and for each car, the `getDescription()` method is called to print.
